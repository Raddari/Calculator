# Calculator
A simple command line calculator utilising Java 8+ features extensively.

## Usage
Supported operations:
* Add      +
* Subtract -
* Multiply *
* Divide   /
* Modulo   %
* Power    ^

Parentheses ( ) can also be used to change order of operations.

There must be exactly 1 space between all operators and parentheses. For example:<br />
  `( 5 + 6 ) * 4 ^ ( 10 - 8 )`<br />
Decimals are also accepted, and negative numbers.

## Notes
There is very little input checking, so expect crashes if the above condition isn't met.

## TODO
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Left-right associativity
- [ ] More Java 8+ magic
